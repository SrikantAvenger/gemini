`generator.py` creates `input.npz` and `output.npz` from the `ccs.asdf` file. This file was obtained as the output of the `apollo cc` command.

To regenerate the `npz` files, besides requirements.txt you will need to clone the apollo repository into `./apollo`.

git clone https://github.com/src-d/apollo.git
